_Explanation of dual reductions in Gurobi._

## Quote(s)

> Reductions are the names given to the different techniques used to transform a model during presolve [...]. Reductions which are solely based on reasoning applied to the feasible region are known as "primal reductions", while dual reductions consider the objective function.  Primal reductions do not remove feasible solutions from the solution space where as dual reductions may, provided at least one optimal solution is guaranteed to remain.

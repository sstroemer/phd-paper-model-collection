_Regarding preservation of ordering in LP files and numerical differences to MPS._

## Quote(s)

> The LP file format is designed to be human-readable. Gurobi writes coefficients in LP files with fewer decimal digits. Also, the LP file format does not necessarily preserve the ordering of variables. As a result, when you export a model to the LP format, read the LP file, then optimize it, the solution path may be different.

> Gurobi writes MPS files with full precision in a manner that maintains variable order.

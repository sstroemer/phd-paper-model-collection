_Comparing "Benders decomposition" and the "L-shaped method"._

## Quote(s)

> So "Benders decomposition" and "L-shaped method" can be interchangeable.

> However, when "L-shaped" is used, one implies the problem is stochastic, as you can find "stochastic programming" in the above title. While Benders decomposition is intended for a more general class of problems.

_Some solvers can be - for most parts - configured to be deterministic._

## Quote(s)

> Gurobi is designed to be deterministic. You always get the same results from the same inputs (model and parameters) on the same computer with the same Gurobi version. Gurobi is also deterministic for parallel optimization: you always get the same results with multiple threads.

> However, if you change any inputs, including small changes [...] then you may get different results, even if everything else remains the same.

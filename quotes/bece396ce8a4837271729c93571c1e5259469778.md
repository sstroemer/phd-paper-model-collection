_On the effect and importance of "crossover"._

## Quote(s)

> Crossover is an essential but often overlooked step needed when solving LPs using a an interior point algorithm (like barrier) or first-order methods (like PDHG). Crossover translates the LP solution into a "clean basic solution" by computing an optimal vertex solution (an optimal basis) from an interior solution.

> Solutions before crossover have noisy values close to zero (we can call this dense) and, more importantly, due to these, they may have violations in various metrics (such as primal feasibility, dual feasibility, and complementary slackness).

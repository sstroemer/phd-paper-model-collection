_Combining interior point methods (initial solution) with warm start advantages of simplex algorithms can be beneficial for repeated solves._

## Quote(s)

> For large problems, often a good strategy is to use the barrier method for the first problem (solved from scratch) and the simplex for subsequent related solves (solved with an advanced basis).

_Regarding feasibility of intermediate solutions of LPs and differences to MILPs._

## Quote(s)

> [...] intermediate LP solutions are quite rarely primal feasible.

> The solution strategy is quite different for continuous vs MIP models. For MIPs, the solver almost always has a feasible incumbent during the search [...]  
> For continuous models, the solver doesn't store feasible primal solutions it finds along its search path (if any). It's typical to have some primal and some dual infeasibility right up until the model is solved.

> [...] the approach to LP in particular has always been optimal-or-bust. [...] I think the reason is that LP and MIP historically used different strategies and users had different requirements for the two problem types."

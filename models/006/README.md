# Model 006

To be explained and tested.

Note: This MPS showcases a model (careful: MILP) that when solved with `HiGHS.jl 1.12.0` returns considerably different (variable) results compared to a solution obtained with `HiGHS.jl 1.12.1`. To be expected on a different version, but could be unexpected for many.

Note: Was using `JuMP 1.23.4` under `Julia 1.11.1`.
